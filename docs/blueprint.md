# **App Name**: AdCreative Insights

## Core Features:

- Account Connection: Connect to Google Ads and Meta Ads accounts via OAuth to retrieve ad creative data.
- Performance Dashboard: Display key performance metrics (CTR, CPA, CPM, Spend, ROAS) for each ad creative in sortable tables and charts.
- Creative Fatigue Detection: Predict potential creative fatigue by analyzing historical performance data and flagging creatives with declining metrics. This tool analyzes the performance data and tells the user if a creative is likely experiencing fatigue.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a deep blue (#1A237E) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds and subtle contrasts.
- Accent: Teal (#00BCD4) for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention.
- Card-based layout for displaying creative performance metrics and insights.
- Use clear and consistent icons for metrics (CTR, CPA, CPM) and filters.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading data and displaying new insights.
